- `int` integer number
- `double` floating-point number
- `char` individual characters
- `string` a sequence of character
- `bool` true/false values

### Declare
Every variable must be declared before it can be used!

Two factors of `declare`
- type
- name

### Initialize
Assign the variable a value

`=` indicates assignment, rather than equal

Three factors:
- name
- assignment mark
- value

Declare and initialize can be combined in one single line.

> Initializing a variable brfore use it is highly recommended

### Arithmetic operator
- `+` addition
- `-` subtraction
- `*` multiplication
- `/` division
- `%` modulo

> Note the order, simply calculation

### Chaining
