### Compile & Execute
#### What
Cpp is a compile language, which requires a *compiler* to translate the human-readable files to forms that computer can understand.

Four phases of programming Cpp
- code
- save
- compile
- execute

comments can use `//` or `/*......*/`

#### How
**Compile** can be called on by using *terminal.* Type `g++ file name`.

Default machine code file `a.out` will be created.

Inserting `-o new file name` to rename the machine code file, can be end of the command or right behind `g++`.

**Execute** works on machine code file. In *terminal*, use `./a.out` to call on

Executable file then be loaded to computer memory and CPU will execute it.
